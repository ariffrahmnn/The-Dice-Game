# The-Dice-Game

This project was started when i havent used github for documentation and start tracking my progress
in the future i will arrange about the documentation, and commit for each file.

This project helped me understand:
a) State management
b) Event-driven logic
c) Debugging array comparison issues
d) Managing game flow across levels

In this project i have implemented javascript to manipulate the DOM, this was the media that
i used to learn about javascript. keep going, Arif 🚀
